## Short Summary
**CivicCoin: Blockchain-powered civic engagement platform rewarding community actions with verifiable badges and tokens via Algorand smart contracts.**

## Full Description

### The Problem
Civic engagement suffers from lack of recognition, verification, and incentives. Community members perform valuable civic actions dailyâ€”from volunteering at local events to participating in town hallsâ€”but these contributions often go unrecorded and unrewarded, leading to decreased motivation and community disconnection.

### Our Solution
CivicCoin transforms civic engagement through blockchain technology. Users connect their Algorand wallets to log civic actions, which are verified and hashed through our custom smart contract using unique event codes. Each verified action earns users tokens, badges, and rewards, creating a transparent, gamified system that encourages sustained community involvement.

### How Algorand Powers It
Algorand's carbon-negative blockchain ensures our civic impact platform aligns with environmental values. The network's instant finality and low transaction costs make micro-rewards feasible, while the robust smart contract capabilities enable secure verification of civic actions. Our custom smart contract hashes event codes to create tamper-proof records of community contributions, building an immutable reputation system for civic engagement.
